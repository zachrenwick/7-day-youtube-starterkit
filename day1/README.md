# Day 1 guide: Research the topic

I'm going to be referencing [this video of mine](https://youtu.be/p0zgKoxpu24) to explain some concepts in here, give it a watch.

- **Time commitment:** You'll need about 2-3 hours for this. For best results, pick a topic you are familiar with, it's the simplest way to get started, because you'll have to research less and you'll be more confident with your delivery.

- **Tools you'll need:** 
    - Somewhere to take notes. It's a good idea to have one area where you have all the research for your videos. Perhaps that's a github repo, OneNote, EverNote, Notion, Apple Notes, maybe even good old pen and paper.
    - ChatGPT. As of 2023, I've been using ChatGPT to generate ideas, research and more. It's cut my research time down significantly. I highly recommend you leverage it as well.

## Goal of this Day

Research your topic enough so that you can accomplish the task you want to demonstrate and explain it with confidence.

## Steps

---

### 1. Pick your topic

I find that this is where most people get stuck. "What am I even going to talk about?" The good news is you don't have to come up with some unique idea because nothing is new on the internet. It's more important to focus on how you are delivering! Try to keep the topic specific, because you'll use it for your video title and thumbnail later on, and it'll help keep the scope and length of the video shorter.

- Instead of trying to cover an entire introduction to javascript, how about focusing an introduction to functions in javascript?
- Instead of trying Azure Functions, how about a specific binding?

You get my point, don't kill your momentum right from the start by picking a topic that takes more time.

- Is there a task you accomplished today?
- Is there something you learned recently?
- Is there an experience you'd like to share? (I really like doing these, most of my latest videos have been on this type.)
- Did you recently pass a certification and want to share your tips?
  
### 2. Research topic and resources

> **Action step:** Create a new note/document (whatever you are using for your video notes) and add 4 headers: Intro, Demo, Conclusion, Resources. We're going to first work on the demo part. The intro and conclusion will come to us easier once we know what we are showing.

Like I mentioned, I'm going to be referencing my [Integrate Azure functions with Azure KeyVault](https://youtu.be/p0zgKoxpu24) video.

I usually start researching how to accomplish the task I am showing in my video. Even if I already know it, there might be some terms or best practices I don't know 100% how to explain, so I'll look into them. My goal is to be able to explain and show something without having too much technical jargon and in a more conversational way.

In the example, it's how to integrate Azure Functions with Azure KeyVault. I'll read some documentation and build a list of resources I can use to learn but also provide for others to explore further. These resources will typically go into the description of the video, more on that in [Day 6](../day6/README.md)

> **Action step:**  Read/watch some resources on the topic you are going to demo in your video. Add to your document, in the resources area, the ones that particularly stand out that you'd like to share.

### 3. Go through your task until you feel confident

> **Action step:**  Run through your tasks a few times, until you know what you're doing and can explain at the same time.

The demos you see in my videos are never my first time doing them. I have to run through them once or twice before I feel good about them. This helps you avoid having to do multiple takes when you are recording, saving you frustration.

### 3. Write down a brief sequence of the task

> **Action step:**  Write a list of steps to accomplish your task.

You've got your topic, know how to accomplish it confidently, now write down a list of steps. It doesn't have to be very specific, this is just for your own personal reference. We'll also use these for your video chapters, more on this in [Day 6](../day6/README.md) For example.

1. Intro
2. Create Azure function in visual code.
3. What is local.settings.json
4. Deploy function to Azure
5. setting up KeyVault in the Azure Portal
6. Create a new secret in KeyVault via the Azure Portal
7. Configure Function settings in Azure Portal
8. Configure KeyVault Access policy
9. How to update a KeyVault secret value

### 4. That's it!

That's it, your document should look something [like this now](integrate-azurekeyvault-with-azurefunctions-day1.md)

Go take a break and move on to the next day whenever you're ready :)
