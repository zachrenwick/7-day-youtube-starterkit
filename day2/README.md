# Day 2: Write the script

Time to write the script. How detailed your scripts are is up to you. At the beginning my scripts contained word by word what I was going to say. Now I can get away with only bullet points. Up to you.

- **Time commitment:** You'll need about 2-3 hours for this. 

- **Tools you'll need:** 
    - The notes you made in the first day.
    - Try using ChatGPT to generate a script for you from your notes. I find this to be a great starting point. 

## Goal of this Day

Write a script for you video. Make sure it sounds like you and covers what you outlined.

## Steps

---

### 1. Write the demo part of your script

We're following the same intro - demo - conclusion format. We'll work on building a script around the bullet points you created in day 1. We can call each bullet point an action. You build what you're going to say around an action. In my scripts I typically put actions inside of square brackets. For example, let's take bullet point 2:

- Create Azure function in visual code.

I would build around this action like this:

- Alrighty, let's [create an azure function in visual code[], I'll click on the azure function extension, next I'll select the folder icon to create a new function project, select my current folder, and I'll leave all the default settings for now, they don't matter much for this video.

That's not exactly what i said in my video, I actually lost the script to that one :( but the approach was the same :)

let's build one more example here

- What is local.settings.json
  
I would build around this action like this:

- Okay, our function is now created, let's now talk about [What is local.settings.json] when we're working locally on a .NET function, this file is where we can store our environment variables. Keep in mind, that this file doesn't get push to production, for good reason. Functions have their own place to configure application settings in production, and to add to that security, we can use keyvault to store those secrets.

okay now your turn, go grab each of your bullet points and start building your script. You'll probably have to walk through your exercise as your writing your script, that's okay and makes it better, the more you practice before recording, the less frustration :)

> **Action step:** Go build your script around the bullet points from day 1.

### 2. Write the intro and conclusion part of your script

These are the easier parts. For your intro, say hi to the people, give a quick summary of what you'll be talking about, and dive right in. People dislike long intros unless they add value.

> **Action step:** Go write an intro for your video.

In your conclusion, summarize your video, inform the viewers on any updates or new videos you're working on, and say goodbye.

> **Action step:** Go write a conclusion for your video.

### 3. Make sure your script sounds like you

This might sound obvious: there is nothing that hasn't been explained or covered. The uniqueness is you, your voice, and your way of explaining things. You'll find your style as you make more videos, but with every script you write, ask yourself, does this sound like me?

### 4. That's it!

That's it, your document should look something [like this now](integrate-azurekeyvault-with-azurefunctions-day2.md)

Go take a break and move on to the next day whenever you're ready :)
