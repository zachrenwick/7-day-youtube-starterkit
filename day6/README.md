# Day 6: Publish the video

In the [start here guide](../start-here/README.md) I suggested gear and software, and tutorials on them. Brush up on those and make sure everything is set up before you get started with this day.

Also here's a video I made on how I [make videos](https://youtu.be/2nPXhwPpy04) might be helpful here.

- **Time commitment:** You'll need about 1 hour for this.

- **Tools you'll need:** Thumbnail creator, YouTube

## Steps

### 1. Upload the video

Go to your YouTube channel and upload the video, as it uploads you can create your thumbnail.

> **Action step:** Upload the video to YouTube

### 2. Create your title and thumbnail

Think of your title and thumbnail as trailers to your youtube video. Use them to build intrigue and don't repeat the same information in them. Check out the thumbnail and title of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgs8oSIjf7A).

- Title: Stop wasting time with cloud courses and tutorials
- Thumbnail: A screenshot of the github repo I talk about in the video and a text that states "do this instead" with a green check mark.
- Content of the video: Building projects is a better way to learn cloud computing instead of always consuming courses and tutorials.

These 2 put together suggests that there is an issue (wasting time with courses and tutorials) but also suggests that a solution will be provided (with the thumbnail). This is what will get people to click on your video. Just make sure the content of the video satisfies the title, if not people will label you as clickbait. 

Leverage ChatGPT here, prompt it to generate "Ideas for YouTube video titles that are 60-70 characters, intriguing, about...) Where about = the content in your video.

If you are using Canva, there are plenty of templates you can use to get started.

> **Action step:** Create your thumbnail and title

### 2. Fill in details of your video

Now it's time for you to fill in the title, description, and more. Make sure you create timestamps for your video and put them in the description. 

Use cards to point your viewers to related content. 

Take a look at the description of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVO75iNc5XI) for an idea of what I do.

> **Action step:** Fill in details of your video.

### 3. Hit publish

Once your video is done uploading, you've added the thumbnail and filled in details you can now publish!

### 4. Share it

Now take your video URL and share it on any social media that you have. When I was getting started I would share on Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, and dev.to

Just don't be annoying and mass message your contacts to watch it, nobody likes that.

### 5. That's it

Go take a break and move on to the next day whenever you're ready :)
